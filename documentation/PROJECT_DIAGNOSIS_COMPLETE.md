## 🔧 COMPLETE FIX SOLUTION

### 🚀 **RECOMMENDED FIX (One-Click Solution)**

**Run this batch file to fix everything:**
```bash
COMPLETE_PROJECT_FIX.bat
```

This will automatically install all required packages.

### 🛠️ **Manual Fix (Alternative)**

If the batch file doesn't work, install manually:

```bash
# Core ML/AI packages
pip install tensorflow>=2.10.0
pip install opencv-python>=4.5.0
pip install numpy>=1.21.0
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0
pip install scikit-learn>=1.0.0
pip install scikit-image>=0.19.0

# Voice command packages
pip install SpeechRecognition>=3.10.0
pip install pyttsx3>=2.90
pip install pyaudio>=0.2.11

# Additional packages
pip install Pillow>=8.0.0
pip install psutil>=5.8.0
pip install seaborn>=0.11.0
```

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### **Step 1: Fix Dependencies**
```bash
# Option A: One-click fix
COMPLETE_PROJECT_FIX.bat

# Option B: Manual installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Test Installation**
```bash
# Quick test
python quick_project_test.py

# Or comprehensive test
